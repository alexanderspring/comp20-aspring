limitations of client-side development
	-cant build anything that is substantial
	-cant store large amount of data
	-limited options for serving files (e.g. github pages)
	-How to deal with custom requests
	-same origin policy
	-cant write to files

Ideas for building web server
-needs to listen at some open port (i.e. port 80)
-how to manage requests (e.g. HTTP GET, HTTP POST)
-how to store data from requests (if any)
-how to respond to requests
-make sure requests are valid
-sanitize requests
